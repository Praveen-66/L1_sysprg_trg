README : for the 'killer' assignment
Part of the 'Linux system Programming' training, kaiwanTECH
May 2020

--------------------------------------------------------
Assignment: killer
Write a program "killer", which should work as follows:
A process traps the SIGINT signal;
It then forks...
The parent then sends the SIGINT signal to it's child;
What happens to the child process? Will it die immediately
or will it execute the signal handler routine?
Test and draw your conclusions.
--------------------------------------------------------

To build:
make

Type
make <tab><tab>
to see all available targets
(remember to put a space after typing 'make').

make <target>
to build <target>.

A few important rules / a quick Checklist for the Programmer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DID YOU REMEMBER TO
✔ Rule #1 : Check all APIs for their failure case
✔ Rule #2 : Compile with warnings on (-Wall -Wextra) and eliminate all
   warnings as far as is possible
✔ Rule #3 : Never trust [user] input; validate it
✔ Rule #4 : Use assertions in your code
✔ Rule #5 : Eliminate unused (or dead) code from the codebase immediately
✔ Rule #6 : Test thoroughly; 100% code coverage is the objective. Take the
   time and trouble to learn to use powerful tools: memory checkers
   (Valgrind, the sanitizer toolset), static and dynamic analyzers, security
   checkers (checksec), fuzzers, etc
✔ Rule #7 : Do NOT Assume Anything
   (“ASSUME : makes an ASS out of U and ME” :-) )
